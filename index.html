					<p>I’m a relatively young, motivated manual mobile phone applications tester who’s looking to progress into the QA testing field. I’ve been working as a manual tester for over three and a half years and in this time, I have completed a level 3 and am about to finish my level 4 software development apprenticeship. I’m looking to learn new aspects of testing such as automated testing and to further develop my skills.</p>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>In my spare time I do a fair bit of gaming, though nowadays I mainly enjoy playing creative games such as Garry's mod (sandbox mode), From the Depths, Minecraft, as well as other games like FTL or Rocket League.</p>
					<p>I also enjoy doing some programming, though it's usually just basic scripting for my games. Recently, I created a couple of bits of code to control in game robots that control the weapons, wheels and even a power system to simulate batteries running out.</p>
					<p>On top of that, I've created a few things for my games such as a model pack with custom textures. This included weapons, different shapes for armor chunks and new textures to go with the models too. I also tried my hand at creating a custom ship for FTL: Faster than Light.</p>
					<p>I sometimes go out in a large fluffy costume to see other people in large fluffy costumes (AKA furmeets). I mainly do this at weekends with some friends to meet up and chat for a bit. Some may see it as strange, but it's a nice social event that helps me to keep what sanity I have left.</p>
					<p>I've built/upgraded several computers in my spare time, some of which I've delivered over 250 miles to the person that bought it off of me. Most of my friends come to me whenever they're looking to upgrade their computers. I really enjoy everything from finding the right parts, budgeting and especially putting it all together.</p>
					<p>I managed to build myself a small combat robot from scratch using motors, a battery, controller chip, and a few other materials. It works fairly well, but I already know a lot of improvements could be made. I've since made plans for a second version that I'll make at some point in the future.</p>
